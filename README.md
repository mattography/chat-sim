This chat simulator pulls usernames from a firebase db. When the user clicks a name from the user list, they'll be shown a predefined messages from that user. Upon entering a message, a predefined reply will be shown with a delay of 2 seconds to simulate a person typing and sending a reply.

To use, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repo to wherever you'd like to run the application from.
2. In terminal, cd to the projects directory and run `npm install`
3. Once the required node packages have been downloaded, simply run `webpack-dev-server`, which will run the site from `localhost:8080`.
